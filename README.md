# SPACE BATTLES

This game was created for a project at General Assembly Sydney. It was made with Phaser3, Nodejs and CSS.

The aim of the game is to collect as many gems as you can without being struck by an aseroid.

### Playing the game

We need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to install and run scripts.

## How the code works

`npm install webpack webpack-cli -g`

`npm update`

Run next commands in your terminal:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install dependencies and launch browser with examples.|
| `npm start` | Launch browser to show the examples. <br> Press `Ctrl + c` to kill **http-server** process. |

---

## Bugs

After running `npm start` visit: http://localhost:8000 in your browser. Your project is running here!

### src directory

Add your project files to the src directory. Only files in this directory will included in the project build!

Updating and saving files in this folder will automatically rebuild the project and reload the project in the browser!
